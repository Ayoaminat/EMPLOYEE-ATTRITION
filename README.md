## INSIGHTS;

For the first objective... based on the analysis performed and the outcomes from the plots done on the 'employee who have left' data,
checking the salary and department column,It is shown in the charts that people in the sales department left more,and also people with low salary.
In the charts that contains both the salary and department,it is shown that employees with very low salary left more in each department,
employees with medium salary left more in hr department and the RandD dept,
equal number of employees with medium and low salary left in the accounting department.

For the second objective...based on the analysis performed and the outcomes done on the 'employees most likely to leave'
 Satisfaction Level: The satisfaction level of employees is found to have a significant impact on employee attrition. Lower satisfaction levels are associated with a higher likelihood of leaving.

Promotion: Employees without any promotion in the last five years are more likely to leave the organization.

Department: A higher attrition rate is observed in the HR and Accounting departments.

Salary: Employees with lower salary scales are more likely to leave the organization.

Based on these findings, we have identified several employees who show a higher probability of leaving the company in the near future.

## Recommendations;

(1)Focus on Employee Satisfaction: The model reveals that satisfaction level is a significant factor influencing attrition.
Employees with lower satisfaction levels are more likely to leave the organization.
To enhance satisfaction levels, the company could consider conducting regular employee engagement activities, provide a platform for employees to voice their opinions or concerns,
and ensure a positive and inclusive work culture.

(2) Promotion and Career Advancement: Employees without any promotion in the last five years are more likely to leave.
A clearly defined career progression path and timely promotion will boost the morale and motivation of the employees. 
Regular talent reviews to identify high-potential employees and providing them with growth opportunities would be beneficial.

(3)Pay Attention to the HR and Accounting Departments: Employees in the HR and Accounting departments seem to have a higher propensity to leave.
It's worth investigating the particular issues in these departments that could be contributing to the higher turnover.
Implementing tailored strategies to enhance job satisfaction in these departments may help lower attrition rates.

(4)Review Salary Structure: The salary scale, particularly for employees on the lower end, directly impacts attrition.
Regular market benchmarking to ensure that the pay is competitive would help in employee retention.
Furthermore, the company could also explore non-monetary benefits and recognition programs, which can sometimes be just as effective as a pay increase.

(5)Investigate Last Evaluation Timing: There appears to be a slight trend of employees leaving following a recent evaluation. 
The company should examine their evaluation process - is it transparent and fair? Are constructive feedback and development plans shared? Is there a trend of employees leaving after poor evaluations?
